# Welcome to "coding_portfolio"!

## [ DESCRIPTION ]

This project uses the Python Flask web framework to implement a basic website that displays the owner's portfolio of coding projects in a responsive manner.  In addition to detailed project descriptions, links to demonstration gifs are also included.

## [ BACKGROUND ]

The goal of this project was to take a deeper dive into fundamental python web programming, as well as classic HTML / CSS.  Although I typically use tools such as bootstrap to implement most projects, it is still critical to understand the underlying technologies these things work.  By digging into the details of HMTL, CSS, and Flask with this project, I had an opportunity to increase my proficiency and fundamental understanding in these areas.


## [ STACK ]
- Python (Flask)
- HTML/CSS

## [ LESSONS LEARNED ]

My biggest takeaways from this project were centered around basic HTML/CSS and python web programming concepts.  For example, I took a deep dive into CSS's 'flexbox' when arranging the project cards on the homepage.  I dug into routing, blueprints, and function decorators while constructing the different web page views in python.  Wrestling with each of thes subtasks has given me a greater appreciation for the abstraction that tools like bootstrap provides to developers.
