        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This repo is a Java app that provides a GUI for users to login and perform CRUD operations on a workout database.</p>
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>This project was part of my Software Engineering coursework. The goal was to setup a basic GUI-enabled Java app using the domain / service / presentation layer design pattern and standard Java libraries. Testing of the project was also included using the JTest library. At the end of the project, the presentation and domain layers were complete. The next step is to implement CRUD functionality in the service layer. The demo gif below demonstrates how the GUI functions.</p>
        <h3>Lessons Learned</h3>
        <p>This was my first exposure to the domain / service / presentation layer design pattern. It was also my first introduction to application testing. Working with the standard Java libraries helped me to get the framework of the application implemented quickly, but the majority of challenges arose when developing the interfaces between each of the individual layers.</p>
        <p>This project taught me the benefits of developing an application using the domain / service / presentation layer design pattern. Although there was a learning curve implementing the interfaces between these layers, separating the logic in this way ultimately helped me keep the code organized and ready for further improvements down the road. Moving forward, I will also give more thought to my testing plan before starting app development. I found it more difficult to develop effective tests after I had already built the application logic, so I think pre-planning in the future will smooth out the process.</p>
